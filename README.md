# Self-Supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection

## Introduction
This project thesis aims to implement an Anomaly Detection framework using a Self-Supervised approach.


Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a subcategory of unsupervised learning. This method can achieve an excellent performance comparable to the fully-supervised baselines in several challenging tasks such as visual representation learning, object detection, and natural language processing.


SSL learns a generalizable representation from unlabelled data by solving a supervised proxy task (called PRETEXT TASK) which is often unrelated to the target task, but can help the network to learn a better representation.<br />
Pretext task examples:
* Rotation classification
* jigsaw puzzle
* denoising

The Pretext Task is solved creating an artificial dataset based on the original unlabelled dataset, where the model is trained to solve a problem in a supervised approach using pseudo labels (autogenerated during the dataset preparation, no human manual labeling).<br />
After training the network, the knowledge (weights) are transferred in a new model (equal or smaller) to solve the so-called Downstream Task (the original problem we wanted to solve), using the original real data.

## Pretext Task
For the pretext task an artificially created dataset is used. It consists of three classes of elements (image without defects, image with large transformation, image with small transformation).
The generation and labeling phase is performed automatically at runtime: during training, for each image in the batch, a random value Y (the label associated with the image) is first generated in the interval [0, 2]. If the value of Y is greater than zero the image is transformed to generate the error. Errors are entered by means of geometric transformations.
If the generated label Y is 0, then only basic augmentation transformations such as Contrast, Brightness, and Hue are applied to the image.
